Hi
I want to learn Flixel more and do some stuff outside of FNF. Yay!
I will post some funny games I can make if I make one.

As for now, there's only basic Hello World from HaxeFlixel.

Currently developing: [Quizomator's Undertale Quiz](https://gamejolt.com/games/undertale_quiz_scratch/666245) Flixel port

I plan to add more games later :).
