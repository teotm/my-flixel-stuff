Hi

I want to learn Flixel more and do some stuff outside of FNF. Yay!

I will post some funny games I can make if I make one.



As for now, there's only basic Hello World from HaxeFlixel.

About to develop: [Quizomator's Undertale Quiz](https://gamejolt.com/games/undertale_quiz_scratch/666245) Haxe port.

I also plan to add Chess too.

I plan to add more games later :).
### Setup/Installation
1. [Install Haxe](https://haxe.org/download)
2. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (read the instructions in the website)
3. In order to be able compile all of the games type in these commands:
	```cmd
	haxelib install hmm
	haxelib run hmm install
	```
